# Welcome to Pyppium!  

Pyppium is a wrapper of Appium-Python-Client for cross mobile testing. :tada:

## Project Motivation

Pyppium has been mainly developed thinking in the *Quality Assurance* cross tests scenarios problems. 

***Among them the most common problems are:***

- :octicons-thumbsdown-16: - *A lot of conditionals along the tests.*
- :octicons-thumbsdown-16: - *Duplicate of screens to isolate the problem above.*
- :octicons-thumbsdown-16: - *Add a baseScreen or a helper to repetitive waits scenarios.*


Thinking in this bored repetitive work and problems pyppium came to help you to dont waste your time with this implementations.

## Philosophy

Pyppium trying to work on technical layer to abstract some appium behaviours to help on QA usability. With pyppium you will see:

 - :octicons-check-circle-16: *Screen Object Pattern with abstraction to fetch elements.*
 - :octicons-check-circle-16: *Cross Mobile Testing focus, with some utilities to commons problems.*
 - :octicons-check-circle-16: *Focus on QA daily problems, like waits, configurations and some boilerplate.*
