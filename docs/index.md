# Welcome to Pyppium!  

Pyppium is a wrapper of Appium-Python-Client for cross mobile testing. :tada:

## Project Motivation

Pyppium has been mainly developed thinking in the *Quality Assurance* cross tests scenarios problems. 
Pyppium has been developed with a focus on *Quality Assurance* cross tests scenarios problems.

***Among them the most common problems are:***

:octicons-thumbsdown-16: *A lot of conditionals along the tests.*</br>
:octicons-thumbsdown-16: *Duplicate of screens to isolate the problem above.*</br>
:octicons-thumbsdown-16: *Add a baseScreen or a helper to repetitive waits scenarios.*</br>

Pyppium to the rescue! You shall not waste any more time with this boring and repetitive work.

## Philosophy

Pyppium tries to work on the technical layer to abstract some Appium's behaviors to help on QA usability. With Pyppium you will see:

:octicons-check-circle-16: *Screen Object Pattern with abstractions to fetch elements.*</br>
:octicons-check-circle-16: *Cross Mobile Testing focus, with utilities to aid with common problems.*</br>
:octicons-check-circle-16: *Focus on QA daily problems, like waits, configurations and boilerplates.*</br>

## Especial Thanks
 
 Pyppium makes use of many packages to try to deliver a good framework. And these packages are amazing, but this should go without saying!
