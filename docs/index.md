# Welcome to Pyppium!  

Pyppium is a Appium-Python-Client wrapper for cross mobile testing. :tada:

## Project Motivation

Pyppium has been developed focusing on the cross tests scenarios *quality assurance*.

***The most common issues are:***

- :octicons-thumbsdown-16: - *A lot of conditionals along the tests.*
- :octicons-thumbsdown-16: - *Duplicated screens to isolate the problem above.*
- :octicons-thumbsdown-16: - *A BaseScreen or a Helper created to repeat scenarios.*

Pyppium can help you saving your time reducing complexity, increasing efficiency and also avoiding these boring and repetitive work problems.

## How it works

Pyppium is based on a technical layer that abstracts some Appium behaviours to help in QA handling. 

With Pyppium you will see:

 - :octicons-check-circle-16: *Screen Object Pattern with abstraction to fetch elements.*
 - :octicons-check-circle-16: *Cross Mobile Testing focus with some utilities to commons problems.*
 - :octicons-check-circle-16: *Focus on QA daily problems (like waits), configurations and some boilerplate.*
